Requires at least: 2.0.2
Tested up to: 3.0

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to easily find synonymous words while your composing
your posts. It's entirely AJAX based, and the code has been meticulously written
and proofread by me.

You can use it for any given purpose. All I ask is that you don't overload it
with requests for every other word. This could strain loading times for you and
the rest of the users of this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `plugin-name.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== How to use this plugin ==
In your post/page/title editing area, simply mark up a word by clicking and 
holding the left mouse key, dragging across the word and release; hit SHIFT
key in your keyboard (the widest key located at the far left). You'll be
prompted with a very sleek window filled with synonyms of the word you marked up,
if any were found and all went well.

You can replace the word you marked up by clicking a word on that list.

That's it. Have fun and may you write plenty of incandescent posts!
